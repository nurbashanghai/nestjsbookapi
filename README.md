## Overview

This project is a Nest.js application for managing books. It includes GraphQL support, TypeORM integration, and other dependencies to get you started quickly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=14.0.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (>=6.0.0)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (>=3.7.4)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for database, optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd books
   ```

Install project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
If you plan to use a local database, ensure it's installed and configured in the ormconfig.json file. You can use PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other supported databases.

Usage
Running the Application
To start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run start:dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default. You can access the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:3000/graphql.

Testing
To run tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test
To generate a coverage report:

bash
Copy code
npm run test:cov
Seeding Data
You can seed the database with sample data using:

bash
Copy code
npm run seed
This is useful for testing and populating the database with initial records.

Deployment
To deploy this application in a production environment, follow these steps:

Build the project:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Set up your production database and update the ormconfig.json file accordingly.

Start the application:
